  summary: |
    LFTP is a sophisticated file transfer program supporting a number of network protocols
    (ftp, http, sftp, fish, torrent). Like BASH, it has job control and uses the readline
    library for input. It has bookmarks, a built-in mirror command, and can transfer
    several files in parallel. It was designed with reliability in mind.
