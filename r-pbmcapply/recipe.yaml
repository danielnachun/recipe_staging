# Package: pbmcapply
# Type: Package
# Title: Tracking the Progress of Mc*pply with Progress Bar
# Version: 1.5.0
# Author: Kevin Kuang (aut), Quyu Kong (ctb), Francesco Napolitano (ctb)
# Maintainer: Kevin kuang <kvn.kuang@mail.utoronto.ca>
# Description: A light-weight package helps you track and visualize the progress of parallel version of vectorized R functions (mc*apply). Parallelization (mc.core > 1) works only on *nix (Linux, Unix such as macOS) system due to the lack of fork() functionality, which is essential for mc*apply, on Windows.
# Depends: utils, parallel
