# Package: mclustcomp
# Type: Package
# Title: Measures for Comparing Clusters
# Version: 0.3.3
# Authors@R: person("Kisung", "You", email = "kisungyou@outlook.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
# Description: Given a set of data points, a clustering is defined as a disjoint partition where each pair of sets in a partition has no overlapping elements. This package provides 25 methods that play a role somewhat similar to distance or metric that measures similarity of two clusterings - or partitions. For a more detailed description, see Meila, M. (2005) <doi:10.1145/1102351.1102424>.
