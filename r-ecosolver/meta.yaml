  summary: R interface to the Embedded COnic Solver (ECOS), an efficient and robust C library for convex problems. Conic and equality constraints can be specified in addition to integer and boolean variable constraints for mixed-integer problems. This R interface is inspired by the python interface and has similar calling
    conventions.
