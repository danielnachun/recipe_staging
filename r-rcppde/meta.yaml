  summary: "An efficient C++ based implementation of the 'DEoptim' function which performs global optimization by differential evolution. Its creation was motivated by trying to see if the old approximation \"easier, shorter, faster: pick any two\" could in fact be extended to achieving all three goals while moving the code\
    \ from plain old C to modern C++.  The initial version did in fact do so, but a good part of the gain was due to an implicit code review which eliminated a few inefficiencies which have since been eliminated in 'DEoptim'."
