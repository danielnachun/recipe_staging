  summary: |
    'This package offers three important components: (1) to construct a use-defined linear::
    mixed model, (2) to employ one of linear mixed model approaches: minimum norm quadratic
    - unbiased estimation (MINQUE) (Rao, 1971) for variance component estimation and random
    - effect prediction; and (3) to employ a jackknife resampling technique to conduct
    - various statistical tests. In addition, this package provides the function for model
    - or data evaluations.This R package offers fast computations for large data sets
    - "analyses for various irregular data structures.'"
