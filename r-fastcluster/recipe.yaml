  summary: "This is a two-in-one package which provides interfaces to both R and Python. It implements fast hierarchical, agglomerative clustering routines. Part of the functionality is designed as drop-in replacement for existing routines: linkage() in the SciPy package 'scipy.cluster.hierarchy', hclust() in R's 'stats'::
    - "package, and the 'flashClust' package. It provides the same functionality with the benefit of a much faster implementation. Moreover, there are memory-saving routines for clustering of vector data, which go beyond what the existing packages provide. For information on how to install the Python files, see the file INSTALL"
