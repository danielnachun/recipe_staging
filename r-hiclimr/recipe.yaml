  summary: |
    A tool for Hierarchical Climate Regionalization applicable to any correlation-based clustering. It adds several features and a new clustering method (called, 'regional' linkage) to hierarchical clustering in R ('hclust' function in 'stats' library): data regridding, coarsening spatial resolution, geographic masking, contiguity-constrained clustering, data filtering by mean and/or variance thresholds, data preprocessing (detrending, standardization, and PCA), faster correlation function with preliminary big data support, different clustering methods, hybrid hierarchical clustering, multivariate clustering (MVC), cluster validation, visualization of regionalization results, and exporting region map and mean timeseries into NetCDF-4 file.
