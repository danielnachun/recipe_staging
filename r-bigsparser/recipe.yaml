# Package: bigsparser
# Title: Sparse Matrix Format with Data on Disk
# Version: 0.6.1
# Authors@R: person(given = "Florian", family = "Prive", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "florian.prive.21@gmail.com")
# Description: Provide a sparse matrix format with data stored on disk, to be used in both R and C++. This is intended for more efficient use of sparse data in C++ and also when parallelizing, since data on disk does not need copying. Only a limited number of features will be implemented. For now, conversion can be performed from a 'dgCMatrix' or a 'dsCMatrix' from R package 'Matrix'. A new compact format is also now available.
