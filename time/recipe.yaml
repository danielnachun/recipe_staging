  summary: time command from GNU
  description: |
    `time' is a program that measures many of the CPU resources, such as
    time and memory, that other programs use.  The GNU version can format
    the output in arbitrary ways by using a printf-style format string to
    include various resource measurements.  Some systems do not provide
    much information about program resource use; `time' reports
    unavailable information as zero values.
