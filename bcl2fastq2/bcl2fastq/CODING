The source tree is constructed to satisfy the following conditions:

1. 	Easy to maintain installation scripts. In majority of cases, no changes
	to install scripts should be needed when new files get added.
2. 	Easy to understand the relationship between the source tree structure and
	the resulting installation tree structure
3. 	Fast developer access (quick branching/tagging). In particular, the ability
	to avoid branching/tagging of rarely-changhing large binary or data files

Please see the corresponding CODING file in each folder for more details
on folder purpose and content naming conventions.
