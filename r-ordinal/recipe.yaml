# LazyData: true

# Suggests: lme4, nnet, xtable, testthat (>= 0.8), tools
# Description: Implementation of cumulative link (mixed) models also known as ordered regression models, proportional odds models, proportional hazards models for grouped survival times and ordered logit/probit/... models. Estimation is via maximum likelihood and mixed models are fitted with the Laplace approximation and adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Multiple random effect terms are allowed and they may be nested, crossed or partially nested/crossed. Restrictions of symmetry and equidistance can be imposed on the thresholds (cut-points/intercepts). Standard model methods are available (summary, anova, drop-methods, step, confint, predict etc.) in addition to profile methods and slice methods for visualizing the likelihood function and checking convergence.

  summary: |
    Implementation of cumulative link (mixed) models also known as ordered regression models, proportional odds models, proportional hazards models for grouped survival times and ordered logit/probit/... models. Estimation is via maximum likelihood and mixed models are fitted with the Laplace approximation and adaptive
    Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Multiple random effect terms are allowed and they may be nested, crossed or partially nested/crossed. Restrictions of symmetry and equidistance can be imposed on the thresholds (cut-points/intercepts). Standard model methods are available (summary, anova, drop-methods, step, confint, predict
