  summary: |
    Fast algorithms for fitting Bayesian variable selection models and computing Bayes
    factors, in which the outcome (or response variable) is modeled using a linear regression
    or a logistic regression. The algorithms are based on the variational approximations
    described in "Scalable variational inference for Bayesian variable selection in
    regression, and its accuracy in genetic association studies" (P. Carbonetto & M.
    Stephens, 2012, <DOI:10.1214/12-BA703>). This software has been applied to large
    data sets with over a million variables and thousands of samples.
