  summary: "The R package 'ashr' implements an Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale hypothesis testing and false discovery rate (FDR) estimation based on the methods proposed in M. Stephens, 2016, \"False discovery rates: a new deal\", <DOI:10.1093/biostatistics/kxw041>. These methods can be applied whenever two sets
    of summary statistics---estimated effects and standard errors---are available, just as 'qvalue' can be applied to previously computed p-values. Two main interfaces are provided: ash(), which is more user-friendly; and ash.workhorse(), which has more options and is geared toward advanced users. The ash() and ash.workhorse()
    also provides a flexible modeling interface that can accommodate a variety of likelihoods (e.g., normal, Poisson) and mixture priors (e.g., uniform, normal)."

# Title: Methods for Adaptive Shrinkage, using Empirical Bayes
# Description: The R package 'ashr' implements an Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale hypothesis testing and false discovery rate (FDR) estimation based on the methods proposed in M. Stephens, 2016, "False discovery rates: a new deal", <DOI:10.1093/biostatistics/kxw041>. These methods can be applied whenever two sets of summary statistics---estimated effects and standard errors---are available, just as 'qvalue' can be applied to previously computed p-values. Two main interfaces are provided: ash(), which is more user-friendly; and ash.workhorse(), which has more options and is geared toward advanced users. The ash() and ash.workhorse() also provides a flexible modeling interface that can accommodate a variety of likelihoods (e.g., normal, Poisson) and mixture priors (e.g., uniform, normal).
