  summary: 'Iterator for generating permutations and combinations. They can be either drawn with
    or without replacement, or with distinct/ non-distinct items (multiset). The generated
    sequences are in lexicographical order (dictionary order). The algorithms to generate
    permutations and combinations are memory efficient. These iterative algorithms enable
    users to process all sequences without putting all results in the memory at the
    same time. The algorithms are written in C/C++ for faster performance. Note: ''iterpc''
    is no longer being maintained. Users are recommended to switch to ''arrangements''.'
