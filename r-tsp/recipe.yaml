# Description: Basic infrastructure and some algorithms for the traveling salesperson problem (also traveling salesman problem; TSP). The package provides some simple algorithms and an interface to the Concorde TSP solver and its implementation of the Chained-Lin-Kernighan heuristic. The code for Concorde itself is not included in the package and has to be obtained separately.
