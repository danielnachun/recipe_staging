	Codesigning GDB
	---------------
	Due to macOS security restrictions, the GDB executable 
	needs to be codesigned to be able to control other processes.

	The codesigning process requires the Command Line Tools
	(or a full Xcode installation). 
	To install the Command Line Tools, run
	
	  xcode-select --install
	
	The codesigning process also requires administrative permissions
	(your user must be able to run \`sudo\`).

	To codesign GDB, simply run the included script:

	  macos-codesign-gdb.sh

	and enter your password. 

	Make sure this environment, "$(basename $PREFIX)", is activated
	so that "macos-codesign-gdb.sh" is found in your \$PATH.

	For more information, see: https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/PermissionsDarwin

	Avoiding being prompted for a password
	--------------------------------------
	On recent macOS versions, you will be prompted for an administrator username and password
	the first time you \`run\` an executable in GDB in each login session.

	To instead be prompted for your own password,
	you can add your user to the '_developer' group:

	  sudo dscl . merge /Groups/_developer GroupMembership $USER
	
	To avoid being prompted for any password, run:

	  sudo DevToolsSecurity -enable

	On older systems you might also need:

	  sudo security authorizationdb write system.privilege.taskport allow

	Intermittent GDB error on Mojave and later
	------------------------------------------
	We've detected you are running macOS Mojave or later. GDB has a known intermittent bug on
	recent macOS versions, see: https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24069

	If you receive the following error when running your executable in GDB:
	
	  During startup program terminated with signal ?, Unknown signal
	
	or if GDB hangs, simply kill it and try to \`run\` your executable again, it should work eventually.

	Showing this message again
	--------------------------
	Once GDB is codesigned, this message will disappear.
	To show this message again, run
	
	  macos-show-caveats.sh
	EOF
    # Copy the message file since we might need to show it in the activate script
    # and conda deletes it after displaying it
