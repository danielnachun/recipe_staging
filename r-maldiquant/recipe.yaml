  summary: |
    A complete analysis pipeline for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and other two-dimensional mass spectrometry data. In addition to commonly used plotting and processing methods it includes distinctive features, namely baseline subtraction methods such as morphological filters
    (TopHat) or the statistics-sensitive non-linear iterative peak-clipping algorithm (SNIP), peak alignment using warping functions, handling of replicated measurements as well as allowing spectra with different resolutions.
