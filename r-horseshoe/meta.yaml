  summary: Contains functions for applying the horseshoe prior to high- dimensional linear regression,
    yielding the posterior mean and credible intervals, amongst other things. The key
    parameter tau can be equipped with a prior or estimated via maximum marginal likelihood
    estimation (MMLE). The main function, horseshoe, is for linear regression. In addition,
    there are functions specifically for the sparse normal means problem, allowing for
    faster computation of for example the posterior mean and posterior variance. Finally,
    there is a function available to perform variable selection, using either a form
    of thresholding, or credible intervals.
